## Flappy Bird for OpenAI Gym

This repository contains the implementation of two OpenAI Gym environments for
the Flappy Bird game. The implementation of the game's logic and graphics was
based on the [FlapPyBird](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird) project, by
[@sourabhv](https://github.com/sourabhv). 

The two environments differ only on the type of observations they yield for the
agents. The "FlappyBird-rgb-v0" environment, yields RGB-arrays (images)
representing the game's screen. The "FlappyBird-v0" environment, on the other
hand, yields simple numerical information about the game's state as
observations. The yielded attributes are the:

* horizontal distance to the next pipe;
* difference between the player's y position and the next hole's y position.

## Installation

To install `flappy-bird-gym`, simply run the following command:

    $ pip install flappy-bird-gym
    
## Usage

Like with other `gym` environments, it's very easy to use `flappy-bird-gym`.
Simply import the package and create the environment with the `make` function.
Take a look at the sample code below:

```
import time
import flappy_bird_gym
env = flappy_bird_gym.make("FlappyBird-v0")

obs = env.reset()
while True:
    # Next action:
    # (feed the observation to your agent here)
    action = ...  # env.action_space.sample() for a random action

    # Processing:
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    
    # Rendering the game:
    # (remove this two lines during training)
    env.render()
    time.sleep(1 / 30)  # FPS
    
    # Checking if the player is still alive
    if done:
        break

env.close()
```

## Playing

To play the game (human mode), run the following command:

    $ flappy_bird_gym
    
To see a random agent playing, add an argument to the command:

    $ flappy_bird_gym --mode random
